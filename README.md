# IoTomize 
An end-to-end IoT Solution.

In today’s day and age, the advent of Internet of things, coupled with the advanced industrial technology, combined with a growing need from the consumer’s side has given rise to an emerging paradigm known as **Industrial Revolution 4.0**.  
 
This coupled with increasing consumerism has ignited the business of Home automation, with Tech Giants like Amazon, Google getting in on the action with their Amazon Echo and Google Home. With scope for much more development with respect to giving the consumer-specific experience. 
 
With this project we plan to create a product to cater that need for personalized care at an entry level coupled with descriptive analytics.

We used the following components:  
* NodeMCU
* Raspberry pi
